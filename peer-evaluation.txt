Project: Space Shooter
Peer's repository: https://github.com/hhhzhao/05-Space-shooter.git



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
I couldn't actually get the code to compile, I got a message saying "no module name for color"
and when I deleted that line of code, the game ran but it was just a blue screen with nothing else on it.
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
Even though I couldn't play it, I like how there are multiple levels, this is definitely
something I would like to add to my 2D games.
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
Besides it not compiling from the "no module name for color" error, I like how there are comments
throughout the code clearly explaning what is happening.
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
I think the comments were great, very well commented.
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
I didn't find anything particularly confusing, but I do have to commend you for spending some
extra time on this project to really go out of your way to include some cool extra features.
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Yes it does.
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
Nope, I think the README file is very descriptive, it describes the point of the game
as well as the controls.
 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
I am sad that I couldn't get this to work on my PC, I'm sure it's a fun game, it looks
like you spent some quality time writing the code and planning out the game to make sure it
is fun and engaging. I like how you used some more complex things within python arcade to add
something unique to the game.
